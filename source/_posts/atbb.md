All things bright and beautiful
Refrain:
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful,
the Lord God made them all.

Each little flower that opens,
each little bird that sings,
he made their glowing colors,
he made their tiny wings. Refrain

The purple-headed mountain,
the river running by,
the sunset, and the morning
that brightens up the sky. Refrain

The cold wind in the winter,
the pleasant summer sun,
the ripe fruits in the garden,
he made them every one. Refrain

He gave us eyes to see them,
and lips that we might tell
how great is God Almighty,
who has made all things well. Refrain





The Mr. McDull version:
《All Things Bright And Beautiful》

曲：英国圣诗
词：何崇志
歌：The Pancakes（Miss.Chan）

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The purple headed mountain
the river running by
The sunset and the morning
that brightens up the sky

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun
The ripe fruits in the garden
He made them everyone

苍翠青山在远方　流水江河迂回
朝日夕阳显辉煌　满天绚丽灿烂
一切美丽光明物　一切活泼生灵

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small.

The words according to Hymns Ancient and Modern (Second Edition - 1875) :
   1. All things bright and beautiful,
   All creatures great and small,
   All things wise and wonderful,
   The Lord God made them all.

   2. Each little flower that opens,
   Each little bird that sings,
   He made their glowing colours,
   He made their tiny wings.


   All things bright ...

   3. The rich man in his castle,
   The poor man at his gate,
   God made them, high or lowly,
   And order'd their estate.

   All things bright ...

   4. The purple headed mountains,
   The river running by,
   The sunset and the morning,
   That brightens up the sky;−

   All things bright ...

   5. The cold wind in the winter,
   The pleasant summer sun,
   The ripe fruits in the garden,−
   He made them every one:

   All things bright ...

   6. The tall trees in the greenwood,
   The meadows where we play,
   The rushes by the water,
   We gather every day;−

   All things bright ...

   7. He gave us eyes to see them,
   And lips that we might tell,
   How great is God Almighty,
   Who has made all things well.

   All things bright ...

   (Amen)

In more modern times, due to its endorsement of the class system, verse three
is not sung.

Refrain

All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful:
The Lord God made them all.

Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings.

Refrain

[Most hymnals omit the following verse]

The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
He made them, high or lowly,
And ordered their estate.

Refrain

The purple headed mountains,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky.


Refrain

The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.


Refrain

The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
To gather every day.

Refrain

He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
