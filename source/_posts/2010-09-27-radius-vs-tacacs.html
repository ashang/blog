<p>radius is UDP, so need re-transmit attempts, time-outs to compensate for best-effort transport, </p>
<p>tacacs+ is TCP, </p>
<p>- ACK within network round-trip time, i.e., RTT, regardless how loaded and slow the backend auth mechanism might be<br /> - immediate indication of crashed, or not running, server by a reset RST;<br />    UDP cannot tell the diff between a server that is down, slow, or non-existent <br />- TCP keepalive, server crashes can be detected out-of-band with actual requests; can maintain multiple server connections simultaneously.</p>
<p>Pakcet encryption</p>
<p>radius only encrypts pass in the access-request packet, from client to server, </p>
<p>tacacs+ has header field to indicate whether the body is encrypted or not</p>
<p>radius combines authentication and authorization, </p>
<p>tacacs+ separates AAA. can use kerberos to do authentication, </p>
<p>permission granted upon particular com,and</p>
<p>TODO: diameter </p>
