> 作者简介
> 亚伦·斯沃茨 (Aaron Swartz)，美国人，软件工程师，作家，被称为互联网之子。RSS、Markdown、CC协议的创造者。2011年，因被指控下载学术期刊网站JSTOR的大量文章，而被捕，判刑35年。2013年早晨，在纽约的一所公寓中自杀。今天翻译这篇十年前的文章，感觉依然振聋发聩。

有些人一早起来就读《纽约时报》，另有一些人睡前要看夜间新闻。有些人从每日秀获得新闻，另一些人从各种博客下载资讯。有些人关注了CNN，为了每时每刻获得最新消息，还有人会让即时新闻自动发到自己手机上。总之，所有人似乎都同意：跟上新闻的步伐是一个公民的责任。所有人，但除了我。

我认为，追随新闻纯粹浪费时间。有些人在较小的规模上同意我的观点。他们指出，有线电视只对各种怪诞的犯罪感兴趣，尽管这些罪行实质上影响力很小；他们也担心那些像赛马一样的政治头条新闻里，隐藏着许多公关宣传。但是，他们这么想，是觉得还有例外：新闻还有救。我比他们走得更远：我认为，所有新闻都没有价值。

让我们看看今天《纽约时报》的头版，它是新闻领域的金线。头条新闻是共和党内讧。还有一张驻扎伊拉克士兵的照片。某股票交易所的头头必须归还一亿美金。公众担心医生们对于一种神经测试系统的过度推销。中国对朝鲜发出警告。一则关于伊拉克暴力增多的报道。还有一种关于虚拟课堂替代真实教学引发担忧的报道。

以上任何一条新闻跟我的生活都没有关系。阅读它们也许会有快感，但那时一种浪费时间的快感。它们对于我的行为没有任何一点影响力。

很多人通常对这一点并无异议，但是认为，了解这类新闻是一种美德，因为它们能让我变成一个更好的公民。他们指出，报纸是我们民主制度的关键，既能揭露对人民所做的坏事，也能让那些为非作歹者住手。

这也许是真的，但令人好奇的是，我从来没有参与其中。如果政府部门犯了罪，《纽约时报》会在头版刊登，有线电视的脱口秀节目会唾沫横飞地讨论不休，政府机构会道歉，然后以一种更精巧的方式犯罪。这确实是一种宝贵的系统–我当然支持政府换一种更巧妙的犯罪方式，但是你会注意到，我如何没有参与。即使没有人读时报，没有人看脱口秀，这一切依然会良好地运转。这是一套封闭系统。

当然，还有选举。但是作为一个选民，只需要在投票前阅读候选人及其议题的简短指南就足够了。没有必要每天都忍受候选人之间你来我往的相互攻讦、恶意诽谤的谎言，以及种种辩白与驳斥。实际上，只阅读投票指南的效果更好：可以排除短期记忆带来的偏见（你只能记得过去几个月中报道的犯罪），你可以听到水落石出后双方当事人的说法，你可以更认真地考虑那些竞选议题，而不必为政治而忧心忡忡。

其他人说，诚然，大多数新闻是没用的，但是你偶尔也能遇到改变你行动的报道。但是，这点的可信度又有多高？对于大多数人来说，生活发生巨大的改变不是因为阅读一篇报纸上的豆腐块，而是因为阅读了更长的文章或是走心的书籍。长文和书籍更具有说服力，也更详尽具体。

对于那些小规模认同我的人，我还有第二个例子。你经常听见电视评论者们说，CNN的即时新闻是荒谬的。这些人建议，记者们应该等待一个消息得到证实后再去报道与评论，否则就会出现下面的场景：“我们有一条未经证实的报道–最新消息！刚刚得到证实，那些未经证实的消息被辟谣了。不，等等。现在有一条新的报道，又推翻了之前对于辟谣的辟谣。”

但是，如果这条建议适用于以分钟计的即时新闻，为什么不推而广之，推而长之？与其看每小时更新的新闻，为什么不读一份日报？与其读反复无常的日报，为什么不读一份评论周刊？与其读评论周刊，为什么不读一份月刊？与其读月刊，为什么不读一本出版周期以年计的书？

人们每天浪费在读报上的时间，本来可以用来读书。书涵盖了绝大部分课题，并且更为详尽具体，对人生的影响远远超过读报摄入的小剂量的信息。但是，人们当然不会阅读一本像报纸一样包罗万象的书，因为其涉猎的课题虽广，但大都离题万里。

最后，我还要争辩一句，追随新闻不但浪费时间，而且还很不健康。Edward Tufte发现，每天早晨阅读《纽约时报》会让他的大脑里充满许多不同的话题，以至于在一天剩下的时间中无法完成真正的智力工作。新闻这种对广泛的话题浮光掠影报道的特点，决定了它有很多错误。（你只需要关注一下报纸的更正栏中有多少明目张胆的错误，就可以对报纸外表之下的犯错能力有一定感知。如果你被新闻报道过，就更知道新闻总是把故事搞错。）新闻对于犯罪和不正常人群的执念，减少了我们对他人的信任。新闻对于信息快餐化的迷醉，减少了我们成为审视熟虑思想者的可能。新闻对于表面现象的执着，使我们变得浅陋。

此文不是为了简单地抬杠，我对自己所写的深信不疑。我起码从十三岁开始就不再关注新闻（偶有少数特别话题除外）。我的生命似乎并未因此而变得贫瘠，相反，我觉得生命因此而丰盈和舒扬。但是，并没有很多人愿意跟我一样冒险一试。

你应当在推特上关注我。

## I Hate the News
Original from Raw Thought by Aaron Swartz
- http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews

Some people start their day by reading The New York Times. Others end it by watching the nightly news. Some get it from The Daily Show. Others download it from a variety weblogs. Some keep up-to-the-minute by following CNN. Others have instant news updates automatically text messaged to their phone. But everybody seems to agree: it’s a citizen’s responsibility to keep up with the news. Everybody except me.

I think following the news is a waste of time.

Some people agree with me on a small scale. Some point out that the cable channels are obsessed with bizarre crimes that have little larger impact, that they worry too much about horse-race coverage of politics, that too much of the news is filled with PR-inserted nonsense. But they do this because they think these are aberrations; that underneath all this, the news is worth saving. I simply go one step further: I think none of it is worthwhile.

Let us look at the front page of today’s New York Times, the gold standard in news. In the top spot there is a story about Republicans feuding among themselves. There is a photo of soldiers in Iraq. A stock exchange chief must return $100M. There is a concern about some doctors over-selling a nerve testing system. There is a threat from China against North Korea. There is a report that violence in Iraq is rising. And there is concern about virtual science classes replacing real ones.

None of these stories have relevance to my life. Reading them may be enjoyable, but it’s an enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact on my actions one way or another.

Most people will usually generally concede this point, but suggest that there’s something virtuous about knowing it anyway, that it makes me a better citizen. They point out that newspapers are a key part of our democracy, that by exposing wrong-doing to the people, they force the wrong-doers to stop.

This seems to be true, but the curious thing is that I’m never involved. The government commits a crime, the New York Times prints it on the front page, the people on the cable chat shows foam at the mouth about it, the government apologizes and commits the crime more subtly. It’s a valuable system — I certainly support the government being more subtle about committing crimes (well, for the sake of argument, at least) — but you notice how it never involves me? It seems like the whole thing would work just as well even if nobody ever read the Times or watched the cable chat shows. It’s a closed system.

There is voting, of course, but to become an informed voter all one needs to do is read a short guide about the candidates and issues before the election. There’s no need to have to suffer through the daily back-and-forth of allegations and counter-allegations, of scurrilous lies and their refutations. Indeed, reading a voter’s guide is much better: there’s no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes reported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the story after the investigation has died down, you can actually think about the issues instead of worrying about the politics.

Others say that sure, most of the stuff in the news isn’t of use, but occasionally you’ll come across some story that will lead you to actually change what you’ve been working on. But really, how plausible is this? Most people’s major life changes don’t come from reading an article in the newspaper; they come from reading longer-form essays or thoughtful books, which are much more convincing and detailed.

Which brings me to my second example of people agreeing with me on the small scale. You’ll often hear TV critics say that CNN’s up-to-the-minute reporting is absurd. Instead of saying, “We have unconfirmed reports that—This just in! We now have confirmed reports that those unconfirmed reports have been denied. No, wait! There’s a new report denying the confirmation of the denial of the unconfirmed report.” and giving viewers whiplash, they suggest that the reporters simply wait until a story is confirmed before reporting it and do commentary in the meantime.

But if that’s true on a scale of minutes, why longer? Instead of watching hourly updates, why not read a daily paper? Instead of reading the back and forth of a daily, why not read a weekly review? Instead of a weekly review, why not read a monthly magazine? Instead of a monthly magazine, why not read an annual book?

With the time people waste reading a newspaper every day, they could have read an entire book about most subjects covered and thereby learned about it with far more detail and far more impact than the daily doses they get dribbled out by the paper. But people, of course, wouldn’t read a book about most subjects covered in the paper, because most of them are simply irrelevant.

But finally, I’d like to argue that following the news isn’t just a waste of time, it’s actively unhealthy. Edward Tufte notes that when he used to read the New York Times in the morning, it scrambled his brain with so many different topics that he couldn’t get any real intellectual work done the rest of the day.

The news’s obsession with having a little bit of information on a wide variety of subjects means that it actually gets most of those subjects wrong. (One need only read the blatant errors reported in the corrections page to get some sense of the more thorough-going errors that must lie beneath them. And, indeed, anyone who has ever been in the news will tell you that the news always gets the story wrong.) Its obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting people. Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less reflective thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.

This is not simply an essay meant to provoke; I genuinely believe what I write. I have not followed the news at least since I was 13 (with occasional lapses on particular topics). My life does not seem to be impoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been greatly enhanced. But I haven’t found many other people who are willing to take the plunge.
