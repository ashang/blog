   Internally, computer times are represented as a count of seconds<br />since an epoch--a well-defined point of time.  On GNU and POSIX<br />systems, the epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, so `@0&#039; represents this<br />time, `@1&#039; represents 1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC, and so forth.  GNU and<br />most other POSIX-compliant systems support such times as an extension<br />to POSIX, using negative counts, so that `@-1&#039; represents 1969-12-31<br />23:59:59 UTC.

   Traditional Unix systems count seconds with 32-bit two&#039;s-complement<br />integers and can represent times from 1901-12-13 20:45:52 through<br />2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC.  More modern systems use 64-bit counts of<br />seconds with nanosecond subcounts, and can represent all the times in<br />the known lifetime of the universe to a resolution of 1 nanosecond.

1972-09-24     # ISO 8601.

       -R, --rfc-2822<br />              output date and time in RFC 2822 format.  Example: Mon,<br />07 Aug 2006 12:34:56 -0600

       -u, --utc, --universal<br />              print or set Coordinated Universal Time
