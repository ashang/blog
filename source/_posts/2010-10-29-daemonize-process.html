<p>Description: turns other processes into daemons<br />
 There are many tasks that need to be performed to correctly set up a<br />
 daemon process. This can be tedious. Daemon performs these tasks for<br />
 other processes. This is useful for writing daemons in languages other<br />
 than C, C++ or Perl (e.g. /bin/sh, Java).<br />
 .<br />
 If you want to write daemons in languages that can link against C functions<br />
 (e.g. C, C++), see libslack which contains the core functionality of daemon.<br />
 .<br />
