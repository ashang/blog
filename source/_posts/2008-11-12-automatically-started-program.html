<p>Another program would be moved out from my automatically started list
<p>I put my often used programs into $HOME/.xinitrc, to make them<br />automatically started by DM at booting, here is the end of this<br />.xinitrcï¼š</p>
<p>export IME=scim<br />export GTK_IM_MODULE=$IME<br />export XMODIFIERS=@im=$IME<br />export QT_IM_MODULE=$IME<br />exec scim -d &amp;<br />exec stardict &amp;<br />exec VirtualBox &amp;<br />exec firefox &amp;</p>
<p>export TERM=xfce4-terminal<br />exec $TERM &amp;</p>
<p># finally start the window manager<br />unset WINDOW_MANAGER STARTUP</p>
<p>exec skype &amp;<br />export WINDOWMANAGER=xfce4-session</p>
<p>exec $WINDOWMANAGER<br />exec qterm &amp;</p>
<p># call failsafe<br />exit 0</p>
<p>One of my often used programs that had been moved out of this list is<br />thunderbird (mutt before this), because I had been used to Gmail as my<br />mail reader.</p>
<p>For important or useful emails, I would tidy them up and archive them<br />in time, both stored in local and remote storage.</p>
<p>Another program that had been moved out is stardict. One reason is<br />that I have to install it in different distros I work with, and copy<br />those dics to $HOME/.stardict/dic. Another reason is the alternates I<br />had found.</p>
<p>One alternate is the web version of this dict, which have enough dics<br />can be self customized:<br /><a href="http://www.stardict.org/">http://www.stardict.org/</a></p>
<p>Another alternate is Google&#039;s dict, with powerful functions such as<br />translating, look-up, and searching for words:<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary">http://www.google.com/dictionary</a><br />This is my default page for native language:<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary?aq=f&amp;langpair=en|zh-CN">http://www.google.com/dictionary?aq=f&amp;langpair=en|zh-CN</a><br />in short, it is:<br /><a href="http://www.google.cn/dictionary">http://www.google.cn/dictionary</a></p>
<p>Which is the next? scim, i think.<br />But I have to choose one alternate, will try and decide one.</p>
<p>Then what next? skype, but not until gmail chat can do voice and video.
